# Cat vs non-cat classifier with core python 
NN.py is a main file, I've not add code to classify on your own cat image but you can do it by reading image with with ndimage and resize it(64 x 64) with scipy.misc.imresize. than rescale it with 255 pixel(iamge/255)
and give that image to predict function as parameters.
